# Entity Schema Extension

## Development

EntitySchema is a MediaWiki extension.
These instructions assume that it is installed with [mwcli](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Cli).

Note that for a working development installation of MediaWiki,
the environment variables `MW_SERVER`, `MW_SCRIPT_PATH`, `MEDIAWIKI_USER` and `MEDIAWIKI_PASSWORD` must be set.
They will also be used for browser testing in this extension.

### Installing the extension
Clone the code into your `extensions/` directory and add the following lines to your `LocalSettings.php`:
```php
$wgEntitySchemaShExSimpleUrl = 'https://shex-simple.toolforge.org/wikidata/packages/shex-webapp/doc/shex-simple.html?data=Endpoint:%20https://query.wikidata.org/sparql&hideData&manifest=[]&textMapIsSparqlQuery';
wfLoadExtension( 'EntitySchema' );
```
`$wgEntitySchemaShExSimpleUrl` is intended to contain a link to a tool that allows checking the current schema against Items.
See the [description of the option in extension.json](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/mediawiki/extensions/EntitySchema/+/ea8b17df26e6ab3499f953faf8e0fa3b5197de81/extension.json#81) for more details.
That value is the same as what is in the Wikidata production configuration at time of writing and is also suitable for development.

Then, in the root mediawiki directory, update Medawiki composer and run the update maintenance script:
```bash
mw docker mediawiki composer update
mw docker mediawiki exec php maintenance/run.php update
```

### Setting up the extension's development environment

Install the npm dependencies,
recommended way is to use the `fresh` tool integrated into mwcli,
by running the following in the `EntitySchema/` directory:
```bash
$ mw docker mediawiki fresh npm ci
```

Install the composer dependencies, recommended way is with [mwcli](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Cli) being run in the `EntitySchema/` directory:

```bash
$ mw docker mediawiki composer install
```

Optionally add a pre-commit Git hook for lint-staged (requires Node, but wont work in `fresh-node` as `.git` is mounted read-only there and php is not available):
```bash
$ ln -s ../../node_modules/.bin/lint-staged .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Running PHP linting and static analysis

PHPCS and other PHP linting
```bash
$ mw docker mediawiki composer test
```

If there are fixable errors, then they can be fixed with:

```bash
mw docker mediawiki composer fix
```

The static analyzer `phan` can run from the root mediawiki directory with:

```bash
mw docker mediawiki composer phan
```
It might take a few minutes to finish as it runs a global analysis.
If there is an issue in non-EntitySchema code, then that might be resolved by
first: making sure all your core/extensions/skin repositories are up-to-date (run `git pull`), and
second: updating composer in mediawiki core (see above).


### Running PHPUnit tests

From the root mediawiki directory run the following:

```bash
$ mw docker mediawiki composer phpunit extensions/EntitySchema/tests/phpunit/
```

All tests should pass on the `master` branch.

However, note that Wikimedia CI runs a subset of the PHPUnit tests, the tests in the _unit_ subdirectory,
with a slightly different command that asserts some more restrictions:

```bash
$ mw docker mediawiki exec php vendor/bin/phpunit extensions/EntitySchema/tests/phpunit/unit/
```

Though this will not work for integration test.
Use that command to reproduce CI failures when working with _unit_ tests specifically.

### Running JS linting

In the `EntitySchema/` directory:
```bash
$ mw docker mediawiki fresh npm test
```

### Running Cypress Browser tests

In general, there are two different approaches to run these tests.
Headless (that is without a window opening, like in CI) and normal.

#### Headless mode

In CI, the browser tests are executed headlessly by invoking `npm run selenium-test`.
To run the browser tests in a headless way locally, we can make use of the `fresh` image that comes with mwcli that is also
already preconfigured to run MediaWiki browser tests:

```
mw docker mediawiki fresh -- npm run selenium-test
```

Note that while there is no window opening, you do get videos in the directory `cypress/videos/`.

#### Graphical/Headful/Normal

For local development where you want to directly watch the browser test play out, then above solution cannot be used.
We must run the browser test in the shell directly, without a docker container.

You can open up Cypress by executing

```
npm run cypress:open
```

### Chore: Updating dependencies

Many of the dependencies of EntitySchema are kept up-to-date by [LibraryUpgrader](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Libraryupgrader).
However, sometimes LibraryUpgrader runs into trouble and therefore we want to make sure to check the state of our dependencies regularly.

In general, we want to keep both the Node.js npm dependencies, as well as the PHP composer dependencies up-to-date.
For the npm dependencies, first make sure your local dependencies are up-to-date by executing `npm ci`.
Then run `npm outdated` to see if any need an update.

Similarly for composer: make sure your local dependencies match what is in composer.json by running `composer update`.
Then check for outdated dependencies by running `composer outdated --direct`.

All dependencies should generally be updated to the latest version.
If you discover that a dependency should not be updated for some reason, please amend this section with the dependency and the reason.
If a dependency can only be updated with substantial manual work, you can create a new task for it and skip it in the context of the current chore.

The following dependencies should be ignored:
- lint-staged:
  [v15.0.0](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/releases/tag/v15.0.0) drops compatibility with Node 16,
  which we still use in CI. Node 18 upgrade pending in [T331180](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T331180).

## Troubleshooting

### I get `tempnam(): file created in the system's temporary directory` when running the phpunit tests?

Add `$wgTmpDirectory = '/tmp';` to your LocalSettings.php.

### I get `Table 'default.unittest_entityschema_id_counter' doesn't exist` when running the phpunit tests?

Update your MediaWiki's composer dependencies as described above.
